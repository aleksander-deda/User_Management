# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

- I have worked recent days in a Django project and my intend was how to setup authentication for a website, like how to create new users, have them signed in and signed out of their accounts! 
 
- I have also worked on permissions and groups and how to assign specific permissions to users and restrict parts of the website to those users. 

- Overall, this project has gave me an in-depth understanding of the Django permission system and grouping and allow you to do some advanced stuff for your own website!

Thanks to **Retool** platform i was able to build an interactive and visual dashboard for my project. 

- You can create your own dashboard for your projects here: https://retool.com 
- My dashboard for this project: https://aleksi.retool.com/embedded/public/c0d55a8b-7556-474e-be1f-725b6febbfd7 


For the database of the project i thought to make smth different so i hosted a **Remoted Postgres Database** from **Heroku**

- You can easily create an account to **Heroku** for free.
- Create new app
- Search and add **Heroku Postgres**
- Then connect your **app** with your **Heroku Postgres**
- Finally find the datas of the database and replace them within your django project.
